<title>App flow Redesign- ParkMobile</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>General Concept: </h1>
    <p> When going through applications to redesign I found many that I thought worked well and then remembered that this summer I noticed one big flaw in ParkMobile's application design. I was parking in town at the beach only to realize that the zone number that I need to put into park mobile was nowhere to be found. I needed to walk about a minute away to find the zone number where I was parking. Although this was not a problem for me to walk and physically find the number, I thought to myself that the app could really benefit from a system that shows you zones on a map and automatically finds which zone the user is parking in. </p>
<h2>Design Question: </h2>
    <p>How can we improve the ParkMobile application for frequent users?</p>

<h2> Research Questions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>How often do you use park mobile?</li>
        <li>Do you find ParkMobile more convenient than paying to park with coins?</li>
        <li>Do you ever find it difficult to figure out which zone you are parking in if there are not obvious signs? </li>
        <li>Rate your overall experience with park mobile from 1-5.</li>
        <li>If you could adjust anything on the ParkMobile app what would it be? </li>
        <li>If park mobile clearly outlined zones on a map would the app be more convenient?</li>
    </ol>
